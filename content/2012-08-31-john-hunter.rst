We have lost one of the greats of our community.

I first met John Hunter when he came to give a presentation about
matplotlib at the Space Telescope Science Institute in 2004 (or
thereabouts).  I remember being blown away by how capable matplotlib
was (even then), and stunned by John's drive to build it completely
outside of what was paying the bills.

Years later, when I started working at STScI in 2007, one of my first
tasks was to add some new features to matplotlib.  Little did I know,
it would become my passion as well.  I was a little intimidated to be
working on something so entrenched and widely used.  But John somehow
instilled confidence in me with his support of what I was doing, even
as I was ripping apart old assumptions in the code and turning it over
anew.  Through all the e-mails, conference calls and chance conference
meetings with John since, he has been the most encouraging mentor and
a prime example of open source stewardship.  I should be lucky to find
even a fraction of the enthusiasm, skill and leadership that John had.

Equally impressive has been watching so many of us Scientific Python
types, separated by geography and institutional affiliations, come
together in supporting each other at a time like this.  Sometimes it
really is more than just code.

If matplotlib has been useful to you in any way, please give
generously to the `John Hunter Memorial Fund
