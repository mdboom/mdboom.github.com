                <p>I've used Linux as my primary driver 20 years now, and have arrived at
a software development workflow I'm very happy with, based primarily
around <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://tmux.github.io/">tmux</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a> and [insert webbrowser here].  I need to write
more about that some day, but in short, the things I like about it is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The ability to do everything without leaving the keyboard.</li>
<li>The ability to customize, integrate and automate all of these tools
so I'm not repeating the same rote tasks multiple times a day.</li>
<li>The ability to put all of the configuration in a Git repo so I can
track changes to it over time and it's easy to set up new machines.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I recently started at <a class="reference external" href="http://continuum.io">Continuum</a>, I was
provided with a shiny new MacBook Pro.  While Continuum doesn't
require I use it for my day-to-day development work, I thought I'd try
to get it working as close as possible to what I'm used to.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Some of this may sound like the rantings of a grumpy old man.
It's not really about objectively better---well, ok, the poor
integration between Unix and GUI apps sucks, let's just get that
out of the way---but most of what's below is just about
expectations and muscle memory.  My goal here is just to make
things easier for others making the switch and as a call for help
for better solutions where things are still lacking.  Please leave
suggestions for ways I can do things better in the comments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="software-packages">
<h2>Software Packages</h2>
<p>Macs don't have a built-in package manager (no, the App Store doesn't
count), but there are a few third party ones: Fink, MacPorts, Nix, and
homebrew (and Anaconda increasingly belongs on that list, though it
remains less of a generalist).  <a class="reference external" href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> seems to
be the one with the most momentum behind it.  It also has the ability
to install native Mac apps (through <a class="reference external" href="http://caskroom.io">Cask</a>)
which turns out to be very handy to set up software without a lot of
clicking through websites and installers.</p>
<p>I won't reproduce installation instructions for Homebrew and Cask
here, but it suffices to say that with these tools I can fully
automate the installation of most of the software I needed from the
command line, very much like a Linux package manager.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="terminal">
<h2>Terminal</h2>
<p>Use <a class="reference external" href="https://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>.  It behaves more like Linux
terminals out-of-the-box and is eminently configurable.  It even
supports middle-click-to-paste.  Awesome.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="emacs">
<h2>Emacs</h2>
<p>There are a bunch of ways to get Emacs on a Mac.  In keeping with
trying to do everything through Homebrew, I opted to install the
Homebrew emacs with native Cocoa bindings, so I pass the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--with-cocoa</span></tt> option to <tt class="docutils literal">brew</tt>.  Also note that HTTPS requests
from Emacs seem to fail from emacs if I don't use the GNU TLS library,
so I also pass <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--with-gnutls</span></tt>.</p>
<pre class="code sh literal-block">
brew install emacs --with-cocoa --with-gnutls
</pre>
<p>You can then add this Emacs to the Applications menu using:</p>
<pre class="code sh literal-block">
brew linkapps emacs
</pre>
<div class="section" id="emacsclient">
<h3>emacsclient</h3>
<p>I use <tt class="docutils literal">emacsclient</tt> a lot to easily open buffers from the command
line (I have it aliased to <tt class="docutils literal">e</tt>), and it's my default <tt class="docutils literal">EDITOR</tt> for
<tt class="docutils literal">git</tt> and such. If you start an Emacs server from within Emacs
using:</p>
<pre class="code lisp literal-block">
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">edit-server-start</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">server-start</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>then the <tt class="docutils literal">emacsclient</tt> binary that Homebrew installed just works.</p>
<p>However, I also use <tt class="docutils literal">emacsclient</tt> to automatically paste links from
my web browser into <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">org-mode</span></tt> task lists.  This uses a special URL
scheme, <a class="reference external" href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html">org-protocol</a> to tell the
operating system which application to use to open the link.  On the
web browser side, you set up a bookmarklet that passes the URL of the
current page to the application handler for the custom URL.  The
bookmarklet looks like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
javascript:location.href='org-protocol://capture://'+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+'/'+encodeURIComponent(document.title)+'/'+encodeURIComponent(window.getSelection())
</pre>
<p>To get this to call emacs on Linux, it's simply a matter of telling
your desktop environment which command to run for a particular custom
URL scheme.  On a Mac, you need to create a full Framework application
to associate itself with the custom URL scheme, with a script inside
it to delegate to the commandline <tt class="docutils literal">emacsclient</tt> application.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I did find such a pre-made Framework app in
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/neil-smithline-elisp/EmacsClient.app">EmacsClient.app</a>. Unfortunately,
it's designed for use with AquaMacs, not a Homebrew-built emacs.  But
that turns out to be fixable.</p>
<p>Download the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/neil-smithline-elisp/EmacsClient.app/raw/master/EmacsClient.zip">EmacsClient.app</a>
zip file and expand it in your <tt class="docutils literal">/Applications</tt> directory.
Right-click on it and choose <cite>Show Package Contents</cite>, then navigate to
<tt class="docutils literal">Contents/Resources/Scripts/main.scpt</tt>.  Open the script in <cite>Script
Editor</cite> and replace the path to the AquaMacs <tt class="docutils literal">emacsclient</tt> with the
Homebrew one (which is normally <tt class="docutils literal">/usr/local/bin/emacsclient</tt>).  Save
the script, and now you have something that associates the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">org-protocol://</span></tt> URL scheme with <tt class="docutils literal">emacsclient</tt>.  Now it's one
click to add a link to a webpage or webmail to your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">org-mode</span></tt> notes
file.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="environment-variables">
<h2>Environment variables</h2>
<p>By default, wmacs, or other native GUI applications, won't pick up any
of the environment variables defined for the command line in files
like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.profile</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.bashrc</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.zshrc</span></tt>, and friends.  This
means that the &quot;inferior&quot; applications that emacs launches may not
match what you would expect in your commandline environment.</p>
<p>Searching for a solution to this problem isn't straightforward, since
Apple has changed how environment variables work with seemingly every
release of OS-X.  The only reliable solution for Yosemite that I found
is a set of scripts called <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ersiner/osx-env-sync">osx-env-sync</a>.  To quote its author,
Ersin Er:</p>
<blockquote>
On OS X, command line applications and GUI applications are treated
differently. (Well this can be put in a more technically correct
manner but this is what you experience from a user's point of view.)
One fundamental difference is that although it's straightforward to
feed command line applications with environment variables, it's not
so for GUI applications. It's even harder to feed both types of
applications from a single source of definitions. (Well, one
particular workaround is launching GUI applications from command
line.) Moreover, OS X's relevant means for setting up environment
variables (or initializing programs in general) have been changing
over time in consecutive releases which makes the situation
worse. Hundreds of topics at Stack Overflow is the living proof of
this mess.</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="keyboard">
<h2>Keyboard</h2>
<div class="section" id="modifier-keys">
<h3>Modifier keys</h3>
<p>Native Mac apps tend to put common keyboard shortcuts on the <tt class="docutils literal">⌘</tt>
key, rather than the <tt class="docutils literal">Ctrl</tt> key used on Windows and Linux.  I tried
to adjust to this for a few days, but ultimately, I decided I can't
fight a lifetime on muscle memory on this one.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Mac OS-X makes it easy to adjust the modifier keys.  Go to
<cite>System Preferences</cite> -&gt; <cite>Keyboard</cite> -&gt; <cite>Keyboard</cite> -&gt; <cite>Modifier Keys</cite>.
In order to put <cite>⌘</cite> in the place I'm used to (on the far left) I had
to remap the modifiers differently for my external PC
(i.e. Windows-style) keyboard and for the built-in laptop keyboard.</p>
<p>For the external keyboard:</p>
<img alt="" src="/images/usb-keyboard-remap.png" />
<p>For the internal keyboard:</p>
<img alt="" src="/images/builtin-keyboard-remap.png" />
<p>So, now we've made most native Mac apps more familiar.  However, now
Unixy apps, such as Emacs and the Terminal are backward!  Fortunately,
both Emacs and iTerm2 have facilities to swap the <tt class="docutils literal">⌘</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">Ctrl</tt>
keys back.</p>
<p>For Emacs, add the following to your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.emacs.d/init.el</span></tt> file:</p>
<pre class="code lisp literal-block">
<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">mac-command-modifier</span> <span class="ss">'control</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">mac-control-modifier</span> <span class="ss">'super</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>For iTerm2, go to <cite>Preferences</cite> -&gt; <cite>Keys</cite>, and remap the modifier
keys:</p>
<img alt="" src="/images/iterm2-remap.png" />
<p>Overall, I'm much more comfortable with this layout.  It does have a
few downsides:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The keybindings displayed on drop-down menus no longer match the
symbols on the built-in keyboard.  Not much of a problem when this
is all muscle-memory anyway.</li>
<li>Letting someone else use my Mac (which happens occasionally when
giving team presentations) is likely to make things explode.  Note
to self: don't share.</li>
<li>Other Unix or X11 apps that don't have the ability to remap keys may
be a problem.  I haven't run into any of these that I use yet, but
it's something to be aware of.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-emacs-keys">
<h3>Other Emacs keys</h3>
<p>Emacs also has some other keys that are mapped differently by default
on Macs.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">Home</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">End</tt> keys move to the beginning and end of the
buffer, respectively, to match the behavior in native Mac apps.  Let's
change them to move to the beginning and end of the line like they do
on Linux (a much more common operation):</p>
<pre class="code lisp literal-block">
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">define-key</span> <span class="nv">global-map</span> <span class="nv">[home]</span> <span class="ss">'beginning-of-line</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">define-key</span> <span class="nv">global-map</span> <span class="nv">[end]</span> <span class="ss">'end-of-line</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">Menu</tt> key (present on many Windows keyboards, but not on the
built-in Mac keyboard) emits <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C-p</span></tt>, so it moves the cursor up one
line.  I never use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C-p</span></tt> in Emacs, so I can just remap it to do what
<tt class="docutils literal">Menu</tt> does on Linux:</p>
<pre class="code lisp literal-block">
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">global-set-key</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">kbd</span> <span class="s">&quot;C-p&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ss">'smex</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>If you wanted to keep <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C-p</span></tt> working in Emacs, you'll probably need
to use a third-party tool such as <a class="reference external" href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/seil.html.en">Seil</a> to remap <tt class="docutils literal">Menu</tt> to
an unused key and then make that work in Emacs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tiling-window-manager">
<h2>Tiling window manager</h2>
<p>Perhaps the single most important productivity tool I use on Linux was
a tiling window manager.  It's very freeing to always be able to move
between applications without leaving the keyboard, and to never worry
about carefully rearranging windows so they aren't partially obscured.
I've used various tiling window managers over the years, but the one
that ultimately best fit my brain and I've really stuck with is <a class="reference external" href="http://i3wm.org">i3</a>.</p>
<p>The built-in window management tools on the Mac always leave me
reaching for the Dramamine, what with all whizzing around and zooming
in and out.  There are a few <a class="reference external" href="https://alternativeto.net/software/slate/?platform=mac">alternative window management &quot;tools&quot;</a> for the
Mac.  I ended up trying most of the free or free-to-try ones, most of
them only handle the window placement part of the problem.  Only one,
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jigish/slate">Slate</a> also supports moving focus
with directional keys.</p>
<p>It's a little tricky to set up as the default keybindings aren't very
intuitive, but it's very customizable and digging into its config file
is well worth the effort.  Even still, the end result is a far cry
from i3.  Windows aren't automatically arranged: you have to manually
place each one as they open.  There's no tabbed stacked windows, so
when windows are stacked you have to flip through each of them in
order to find the one you want (or fall back on <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">⌘-Tab</span></tt>).  And when
the screen locks, everything becomes misplaced and you have to
rearrange the windows again, though that seems to be a problem in
general on a Mac.</p>
<p>Tiling managers are a polarizing technology.  As one who is in the
&quot;love it&quot; camp, I feel that may be the one pain point that sends me
running back.</p>
